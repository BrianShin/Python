# Python
Python Beginner. All these projects are projects from an online course syllabus. 
I tutored a student in an introduction to programming on an online course using Python.

I have never used Python before but understanding the concept of programming allowed me 
to explain it in terms the student would be able to understand.

For the sake of the answers to not be copied from other potential and future students of 
that online course, I will not be mentioning the school's name.

Projects:

Temperature Conversion.
  - Had to calculate Celcisus to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
  - Had to create an input and output the conversion. 
  
Georgian Calendar.
  - Create a program that calculates whether the input year is a Martian leap year or not.
  - Martian Leap Years are ddd years and years that are divisible by 10.
